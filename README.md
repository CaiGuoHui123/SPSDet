Small target detection in maritime vessel images is a major challenge in computer vision, primarily due to the limited data available for small-sized targets, which are often obscured by larger objects or background noise. Traditional Transformer-based models are usually constrained by the size of specific datasets, making it difficult to effectively handle targets with varying orientations and scales. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more flexible and lightweight models to address these issues. To this end, this paper proposes two innovative methods that significantly improve the detection and segmentation performance of small vessels. First, we integrate the newly developed lightweight YOLO v9 architecture with the SliceBoost framework, leveraging programmable gradient information (PGI) to reduce significant information loss during feature extraction. Meanwhile, we employ the Vision Mamba model, which enhances spatial awareness by introducing position embeddings and a novel bidirectional state-space model (SSM) to effectively improve contextual modeling capabilities. This model adaptively combines the efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in processing local features with the advantages of Transformers in capturing global information, making it particularly suited for detecting small vessels in infrared maritime images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve significant improvements in both detection accuracy and processing efficiency, proving their real-time small target detection capabilities in various maritime scenarios. The paper also discusses the potential applications of these techniques in future maritime target recognition tasks.
